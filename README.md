# PoissonDistribution
PoissonDistribution is a jupyter file which illustrates theory and use of the poisson distribution concept using python.

The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate of occurrence. 
It's often used to describe rare events that happen independently of each other.
